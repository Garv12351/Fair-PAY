# 💼 Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict salaries based on employee features such as age, experience, and gender. It helps **organizations** assess fair compensation practices and allows **employees** to verify if they are being underpaid.

Built using Python in Google Colab, this project demonstrates how data analysis and regression models can be used to create salary prediction systems.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### From the Organization's Perspective:
- Ensure fair and unbiased compensation structures.
- Identify potential gender or age-based disparities in pay.

### From the Employee's Perspective:
- Understand if their current salary is in line with their qualifications and experience.
- Gain data-driven insights for negotiation or personal assessment.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning (Linear Regression, metrics)

---

## ⚙️ Features & Workflow

1. **Upload CSV Dataset**  
   Dataset includes `Age`, `Experience`, `Gender`, and `Salary`.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates  
   - Encode categorical data

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Pair plots for feature relationships

4. **Model Training**  
   - Linear Regression for salary prediction  
   - R² Score and Mean Squared Error used for evaluation

5. **Result Visualization**  
   - Compare predicted vs actual salaries

---

## 📈 Results

- Model trained with good accuracy (high R² Score)
- Predictions align well with real salary data
- Visual feedback confirms model effectiveness

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project effectively uses ML to:
- Highlight unfair salary distributions
- Promote transparency and equity
- Help HR teams and employees make informed decisions

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Include more features (e.g., job role, education)
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy as a web app for interactive use
- Use industry benchmark APIs for real-time validation
